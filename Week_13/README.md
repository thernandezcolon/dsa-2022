## Week 13

This assignment covers Seaborn and plotting time series data. Only a couple of minor tweaks have been made since the 2021 version. The repo contains an assignment and a solution guide. The image file in the subfolder is necessary for the participants to complete the assignment. While it does not render correctly on GitHub, it should render when run from a desktop / Google Colab. 

The anticipated Kahoot activity is still in progress.
