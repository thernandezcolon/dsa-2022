## Begin your capstone proposal

In order to bring everything you've learned together, you are going to be working on a real-world problem at RV.  The first step we are going to take is 

1) In the root of your GitHub repository, ensure there is a `capstone` folder
2) In that folder, commit a file called `proposal.md`
3) Inside `proposal.md` begin a document with the following sections. Here is the [proposal template](https://github.com/RedVentures/homegrown-2022-participants/blob/master/Curriculum_and_Homework/200-Level/capstone/proposal.md).
